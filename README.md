# DSAD-encrypt-decrypt
Digital Signal Encode, Encrypt, Decode, Decrypt project for CSCI 2070

<br/>
This was a project for CSCI 2070 (Cryptography course) at Armstrong State University. <br/>
The premise is that it allows someone to generate a string, convert it to binary, encode it, encrypt it, transmit it, decode it, and decrypt it.  It is a java-based secure messaging system based off cryptography principles learned during the class.
